# Challenges

## Challenge One

Create a README.md file in your `git-practice` folder. In the file, using your text editor, add a heading and a description. Save, stage, commit, and push your new README.md file to GitHub.

## Challenge Two

Create a completely new repository in your `projects` directory and push it to GitHub. It could be a list of useful commands you've learned, a short poem, or anything else you'd care to track, store, and share.
